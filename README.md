# vgg11-masked-face-recognition
Fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-11 image classification model to recognize whether someone is wearing a mask or not

Run through this notebook to download (my uploaded) image dataset from Kaggle and fine-tune a powerful pre-trained neural net for task-specific classification. It will learn to recognize whether a person in a photo is wearing a mask or not. You can also play around with the learning rate and other hyperparameters to see how accurate it gets!

Enjoy! :)
